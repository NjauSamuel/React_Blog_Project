            <h2>7. The useReducer Hook</h2>

            <p id="paragraph-like">
                The <b>useReducer</b> hook is used for state management. <br /><br />

                Why use useReducer while we have the useState hook? <br /><br />

                1. The useState hook is based on the useReducer hook. <br /><br />

                2. useReducer hook is an alternative of the useState hook. <br /><br />

                Example of useReducer hook in action:<br /><br />
